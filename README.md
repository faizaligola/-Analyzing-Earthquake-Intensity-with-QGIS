## Results
Witnessing the movement of seismic waves through the Earth's crust proved to be remarkable. Notably, specific regions exhibited clusters of seismic activity, providing valuable insights into areas prone to earthquakes.

The data uncovered diverse seismic events, spanning from minor tremors to powerful quakes, each revealing unique patterns and energy releases.

Classifying these earthquakes into low, medium, and high magnitudes—represented as black dots, red markers, and purple symbols, respectively—highlighted their frequency.

In the past month, there was a prevalence of low and medium magnitude earthquakes, with high magnitude events being infrequent. This could pose significant risks, particularly in densely populated regions like the Middle East, impacting water resources and potentially resulting in loss of life.

Remarkably, seismic events demonstrated a wide range of magnitudes and depths, underscoring the intricate nature of the Earth's subsurface structures and their impact on seismic behavior. Moreover, high magnitude earthquakes often coincided with surrounding low and medium magnitude events, illustrating the complex interplay between seismic activities of varying intensities.
